# Advanced Data Structures Implementations

Welcome to the Advanced Data Structures repository! This repository contains implementations of various advanced data structures, aimed to save time by providing reusable code for common and complex data structures used in competitive programming, algorithmic challenges, and interview preparation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of **advanced data structures** with clean and efficient implementations. This collection allows developers, students, and professionals to quickly reference or reuse code in their projects or competitive programming tasks, rather than implementing these data structures from scratch every time.

## Data Structures Included

- **Segment Tree**: Efficient range queries and updates.
- **Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: Efficient prefix sum and range query updates.
- **Trie**: For efficient string searching and prefix-based queries.
- **Suffix Tree**: For pattern matching and string-related algorithms.
- **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Interval Search Tree**: Handling intervals and range overlaps.
- **k-d Tree**: Efficient multidimensional search queries.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Balanced binary search tree used in maps and sets.
- **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**: Efficient handling of connected components.
- **Treap**: A randomized binary search tree for efficient insertions and deletions.
- **B-Tree**: Balanced tree used in databases and file systems.

## Usage

Each data structure is implemented in a modular way, making it easy to include and use in your own projects. The repository is structured in a way that each data structure has its own directory containing:

- **Code Implementation**
- **Example Usage**
- **Test Cases**

## Why Use This Repository?

- **Time-saving**
- **Optimized**
- **Reusability**
- **Learning Resource**

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please submit a pull request if you would like to contribute additional data structures or optimizations.
