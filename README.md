Advanced Data Structures Implementations
Welcome to the Advanced Data Structures repository! This repository contains implementations of various advanced data structures, aimed to save time by providing reusable code for common and complex data structures used in competitive programming, algorithmic challenges, and interview preparation.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive collection of advanced data structures with clean and efficient implementations. This collection allows developers, students, and professionals to quickly reference or reuse code in their projects or competitive programming tasks, rather than implementing these data structures from scratch every time.

Data Structures Included
This repository covers several advanced data structures that are commonly used in solving complex problems. The data structures currently implemented include:

Segment Tree: Efficient range queries and updates.
Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree): Efficient prefix sum and range query updates.
Trie: For efficient string searching and prefix-based queries.
Suffix Tree: For pattern matching and string-related algorithms.
AVL Tree: Self-balancing binary search tree.
Interval Search Tree: Handling intervals and range overlaps.
k-d Tree: Efficient multidimensional search queries.
Red-Black Tree: Balanced binary search tree used in maps and sets.
Disjoint Set (Union-Find): Efficient handling of connected components.
Treap: A randomized binary search tree for efficient insertions and deletions.
B-Tree: Balanced tree used in databases and file systems.
More data structures will be added over time.

Usage
Each data structure is implemented in a modular way, making it easy to include and use in your own projects. The repository is structured in a way that each data structure has its own directory containing:

Code Implementation: Well-commented and clean implementations.
Example Usage: Demonstrating how to use the data structure.
Test Cases: Sample test cases to validate the implementations.
Feel free to clone the repository and use any of the implementations in your own projects.

Why Use This Repository?
Time-saving: Avoid reimplementing advanced data structures from scratch.
Optimized: Efficient code with an emphasis on performance.
Reusability: Easily integrate the code into your projects.
Learning Resource: A reference point for understanding advanced data structure implementation.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have optimized versions or additional data structures to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and includes test cases.
